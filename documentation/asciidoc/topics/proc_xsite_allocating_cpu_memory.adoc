= Allocating CPU and memory for Gossip Router pod

[role="_abstract"]
Allocate CPU and memory resources to {brandname} Gossip Router.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is only valid if `service.sites.local.discovery.launchGossipRouter` is set to `true`, which is the default value.
====

.Procedure

. Allocate the number of CPU units with the `service.sites.local.discovery.cpu` field.
. Allocate the amount of memory, in bytes, with the `service.sites.local.discovery.memory` field.
+
The `cpu` and `memory` fields have values in the format of `<limit>:<requests>`.
For example, `cpu: "2000m:1000m"` limits pods to a maximum of `2000m` of CPU and requests `1000m` of CPU for each pod at startup.
Specifying a single value sets both the limit and request.
+
. Apply your `Infinispan` CR.
